Realtionships Beteen Classes

		So far: we have looked at class aggregation

			Class A has-a instance of classB

			This allows A to make use of what has already been done


Sharing Data between Classes

		Aggregation(Has- A) is one way to share data between classes

			Can only use publi parts of the class

			is the this a limitation of an advatage?

Aggregation vs Inheritance

		Aggregation: small projects with less complexity

		Inheritance: large and reusable projects

How does inheritance work?

	new clss keyword extends

		defines the inheritence relationship[

		UML: arrow w/ open, open, open head 

	new method/data visibility keyword

		protected

			This data item is visible both inside the class and to classes that 				extend this class.

			Also visible to othe rclasses in the same package.

			UML: #.

	
	terminology
		
		Subclass can be called: child class
