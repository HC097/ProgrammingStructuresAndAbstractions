What I meant by "watered down" is that the two ethics mentioned basically have an aim at nearly the same thing, but Kantian ethics seems to establish that rules precede the makers of them. By Kantian machinations, one could postulate that the unconscious acting out of models of behavior precede the conscious action of articulating them as rules (which Carl Jung posits in his analytical psychology) and, therefore, the laws preceded the time when they were spoken. One could posit a claim to natural rights (which rest upon the idea of individual sovereignty) out of either but the difference is that one centers itself on the claim that one can have natural rights by the transcendent while the other is only sanctioned by your fellow man. Watered down = ethics emerging from incomprehensible transcendent (Kantian) to ethics emerging from a conscious ball of meat roaming about on a rock (Rule Utilitarianism). The rules of Kantian ethics are more firm (in that there is far less room for a justification in breaking them) than those in a Rule Utilitarian mindset. It is representative of the classic "man should not, for there are things beyond him which deem it should not be in order for what may be mankinds benefit" juxaposed to "man should not, for others tell him he should not for mankinds benefit". Newtonian vs. Darwinian. Parmenidean vs. Heraclitean. Permenance vs. Flux.
