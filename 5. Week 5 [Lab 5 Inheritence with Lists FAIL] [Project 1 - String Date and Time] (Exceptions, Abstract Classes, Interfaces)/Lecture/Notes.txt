		}finally{

	When an exception happens it is thrown. JVM is looking for a catch block to deal 		with the exception. If you don't know what type of exception is thrown, all 			encompassing e.


	Throwable class at top of hierarchy breaks into errors (error class) and exceptions 		(exception class)

		Errors are not related to the programs. They can not be handled. Must 		stopped exectution gracefully.

		Exceptions are related to the progams. They can be handled.


	Runtime error helps distinguish between check exceptions and unchecked exceptions.



	try{
	}
	throw e;
	 or
	throw new MyException("foo");


	You might want to rethrow the original exception obect or create a new one to throw 	when you can't catch 

	Better specific and segmented so you properly handle each exception.
	
	Finally block always gets executed regardless of whether there is an exception or not.
